I am a solar physics PhD student focusing on improving the expressiveness and flexibility of non-LTE radiative transfer simulations (including as a component of multiphysics radiation hydrodynamics), in addition to investigating how leveraging machine learning can both accelerate these and enable the solution of inverse problems with extremely numerically intensive forward components.

Some things you may be looking for:
-  Lightweaver âœ¨: My flexible radiative transfer framework, heavily inspired by PyTorch _et al_, allowing for flexibility in Python but retaining high performance through the C++ (and CUDA soonâ„¢) backend.
- RADYNVERSION ðŸ¤– ðŸ’­: An invertible neural network approach to the problem of recovering solar flare atmospheric properties from observations, trained from radiation hydrodynamic simulations (PyTorch).
- Lightspinner ðŸ“š: A pure Python simplified version of an old branch of Lightweaver. Dissect the code in a few days and learn the basics of non-LTE radiative transfer through the Rybicki-Hummer 1992 method!
- Thyr ðŸ“¡: An orthographic raymarcher for computing accurate and aesthetic gyrosynchrotron radio emission from a highly flexible combination of dipole loop models using the original torch (LuaJIT).
- WenoInterpolation ðŸ“ˆ: An optimized implementation of the well-behaved non-oscillatory WENO4 interpolation method of Janett et al (2019) using the numba JIT for speed ðŸ”¥.

Concepts I ðŸ’–:
- Anything high-performance that doesnâ€™t compromise on its API.
- Data oriented design.
- Fancy rendering technology.
- Clever applications of metaprogramming.

I am always looking to get involved with interesting projects like those listed above!
